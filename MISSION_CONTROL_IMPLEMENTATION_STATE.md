# Mission Control OS — Implementation State

## Canonical repository

`jdatom88/Mission-Control-Test-01`

GitHub is the authoritative source for implemented state.

## Current stage

Stage 2 — direct Google Calendar connector validation complete.

## Current milestone

Review and merge draft PR #3, then begin the first governed briefing vertical slice using the Tested Calendar Service.

## Implemented

- Calendar Service implementation using the maintained `icalendar` library
- Parse-back and artifact existence validation for ICS generation
- Canonical connector state enum and user-facing state messages
- Initial calendar regression tests
- Calendar regression suite executed successfully: 3 tests passed
- Stage 1 acceptance ICS generated with `America/Los_Angeles`, validated, delivered by email, and successfully imported into Apple Calendar
- Calendar Event Schema / Service and ICS Export promoted from Prototype to Tested
- Provider-neutral direct-calendar orchestration behind the Calendar Service boundary
- Thin Google Calendar API v3 adapter using write-access preflight, `events.insert`, and independent `events.get` verification
- Duplicate-safe Google event IDs derived from caller-preserved Mission Control operation IDs
- Fail-loud direct connector outcomes for wrong account, insufficient scope, expired authorization, provider unavailability, execution failure, and verification failure
- Direct-connector and Google-adapter regression coverage; full suite passes 16 tests
- Live owner-access preflight against the connected primary Google Calendar
- Authorized live event creation followed by independent ID-based read-back; all observable semantics and equivalent start/end instants matched
- Authorized deletion followed by a bounded active-calendar search confirming the test event was absent
- Five persistent `America/Los_Angeles` work events created for August 17–21, 2026, independently read back, and found active at the requested 7:00 AM–5:30 PM local times
- User confirmed all five persistent events were visible in the calendar; the events remain active until separately deleted
- Direct Google Calendar Write promoted from Prototype to Tested
- Stage 1 GitHub Issue #1 and Stage 2 GitHub Issue #2 closed with acceptance evidence
- Repository README and dependency manifests

## Experimental / not yet promoted to Stable

- Calendar Service and ICS Export are Tested but not yet Stable
- Connector state model
- Direct Google Calendar Write is Tested but not yet Stable

## Blockers

- No remaining blocker for Stage 1 Calendar Service acceptance
- No remaining blocker for Stage 2 Tested maturity
- The live connector read-back does not expose the provider's raw `start.timeZone` and `end.timeZone` values; retain this as a Stable-maturity hardening item
- OAuth credentials remain externally managed; no credential or token file belongs in the repository

## NEXT

1. Review and merge draft PR #3 from `stage2-google-calendar` into the canonical branch.
2. Begin one briefing vertical slice that consumes the Tested Calendar Service and preserves the ratified inline-proposal and reinforced approval-queue loop.
3. Preserve Approve, Edit, Reject, and Defer; renewed approval after material edits; provider read-back; and verified ICS email fallback.
4. Retain raw Google IANA-timezone field retrieval as a hardening task before promoting Direct Google Calendar Write to Stable.

## Do not start yet

- Do not implement the full Executive Brief, Intelligence Brief, Flash Brief, RIE, MCOM, Career Lab, or Gmail workflows in code yet.
- Do not create parallel repositories.
- Do not redesign established architecture unless implementation exposes a concrete conflict.
- Surface architecture conflicts back to Mission Control Development rather than inventing new governing rules during implementation.

## Handoff rule

Every implementation session should begin by reading:

1. `MISSION_CONTROL_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md`
2. `docs/GOVERNING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`
4. the open GitHub issue for the current milestone

At the end of meaningful work, update this file so the `NEXT` section remains the authoritative continuation point.
